            <h3>FAQs</h3>

            <br>
            <h3>Who is eligible to use this website?</h3>
            <p class="ans">
                This website is intended for current and prospective DLSU Information Systems students.
                It is designed to assist students in planning their academic schedules for upcoming terms,
                particularly those who need to retake previously failed courses.
            </p>

            <h3>Can this system accommodate multiple failed courses?</h3>
            <p class="ans">
                Yes. The system is capable of handling multiple failed subjects and will adjust the generated
                schedule accordingly to align with the student’s academic requirements.
            </p>

            <h3>Does the system consider course availability per term?</h3>
            <p class="ans">
                No. The system generates recommendations based solely on the official program flowchart
                and does not account for actual course offerings listed in the MLS for a specific term.
            </p>

            <h3>How does the scheduler determine course prioritization?</h3>
            <p class="ans">
                The system prioritizes courses based on the following criteria:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Failed courses and their prerequisite requirements</li>
                <li>Courses required for future major subjects</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Is this tool exclusively for students who have failed courses, or may shiftees also use it?</h3>
            <p class="ans">
                The tool is available to both students who have failed courses and those who are planning to shift programs.
